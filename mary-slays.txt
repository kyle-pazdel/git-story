There once was a girl named Mary. She often got bored, sitting at home. One night she heard a loud and rhythmic thumping from down the street. As she drew closer to the booming she realized that the sound was a gay club. Mary learned that night that she had the deadliest death-drop in the land. From then on, she was named "Queen-Mary-SLAY."
