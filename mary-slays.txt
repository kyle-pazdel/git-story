There once was a girl named Mary. She often got stir crazy at home. One night she heard booming from down the street. As she drew closer to the booming she realized that the sound was a gay club. Mary learned that night that she had the deadliest death-drop in the land. From then on, she was named "Queen-Mary-SLAY."
